Poor Mans Jira.

- Adding a new note while searching will immediately hide it if it doesn't match, which makes sense but is confusing

- Animations for link clicking, collapsing notes

- Maybe two main shell components (Navigation/Content)

- Lock/Unlock feature? Turns a note into read only from the menu

- Use true contenteditable attribute instead of inputs for note/details like Workflowy
- Keyboard commands (enter new note, shift and ctrl+shift to change parent)
- Bold/Italic support

- Add hyperlink support

- Add a copy to clipboard button next to details?

- useImmer instead of useState everywhere for consistency

- If no file is loaded, should default to an instructional content page
