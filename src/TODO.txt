Poor Mans Jira.

- Adding a new note while searching will immediately hide it if it doesn't match, which makes sense but is confusing

- Animations for link clicking, collapsing notes

- Keyboard commands (enter new note, shift and ctrl+shift to change parent)

- Add hyperlink support

- Add a copy to clipboard button next to details?

- useImmer instead of useState everywhere for consistency
