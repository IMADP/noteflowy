Poor Mans Jira.

- Drag and drop

- Link Modal/style 

- Note ordering needing, maintain order on update, dragging

- Animations for link clicking, collapsing notes

- Keyboard commands (shift and ctrl+shift to change parent)

- Pressing enter to create note should give focus
- Pressing enter to create note should create next to previous (requires ordering)

- Add partial hyperlink support? (onselectionchange event needed to popover highlighted text)

- Adding a new note while searching will immediately hide it if it doesn't match, which makes sense but is confusing

- Add a copy to clipboard button next to details?

- Menu stays open after deleting/add url
